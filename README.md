# *Shuru Summer Hack '24*: Building a No-Code AI Agent Playground
<br>

#### ```Think of a space where you can create and interact with digital characters that can chat, learn, and adapt. What would you build? Who would you create?```

<br>
Our goal is to make AI tools more accessible and user-friendly. We want to create a no-code tool where people can design, deploy, and chat with personalized AI agents in a simple and intuitive way. <br>
Would you invite other agents into your playground? Would you keep the playground public? <br> Think of fun interactions that could take place between the agents and users! <br>
Over the month of June, you'll work on a range of challenges, from designing UI/UX and character avatars, to developing AI script systems and building a web interface. We'll provide the resources and support â€“ you bring your coding skills!

### What is AutoGen?

AutoGen is a framework that enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other or to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.

### Installation

To get started with AutoGen, follow the installation instructions: [Installation | AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/installation/)

### Configure AutoGen

Learn how to configure AutoGen for your LLM application: [LLM Configuration | AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/topics/llm_configuration/)

### Running LLMs Locally

To run LLMs locally, use the following tools:
